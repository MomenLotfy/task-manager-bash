## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── task_manager.sh      # main script
├── tasks.txt            # auto-generated data file (created on first run)
└── README.md
```

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash

```

## 🗂️ Data Storage

All tasks are stored in `tasks.txt`, one task per line, fields separated by `|`:

```
ID|Title|Priority|DueDate|Status
```

**Example:**
```
1|Buy groceries|high|2025-06-01|pending
2|Study for exam|medium|2025-05-20|in-progress
3|Submit report|low|2025-04-10|done
```

| Field    | Values                          |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| ID       | Auto-generated integer          |
| Title    | Any text (no `\|` allowed)      |
| Priority | `high` / `medium` / `low`       |
| Due Date | `YYYY-MM-DD` format             |
| Status   | `pending` / `in-progress` / `done` |
